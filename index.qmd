::: {#hero-heading}

I am a graduate student at the University of British Columbia in the Department of Experimental Medicine,working under the supervision of 
Dr. Gordon A. Francis, 

My work is about understanding the development of atherosclerosis. I am specifically interested in understanding macrophage smooth muscle cell
interactions in the lipid uptake and development of foam cells. 

Outside the research lab, I am interested in volunteering, hiking and traveling. Feel free to connect with me.
