::: {#hero-heading}

I am a graduate student at the University of British Columbia in the Department of Experimental Medicine. 

My work is about understanding the development of atherosclerosis. I am specifically interested in understanding macrophage smooth muscle cell
interactions in the lipid uptake and development of foam cells. 

Outside the research lab, I am interested in volunteering, hiking and traveling. Feel free to connect with me.
